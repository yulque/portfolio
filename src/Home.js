      Hi, I'm a Toronto-based software developer <br />
      who loves building good products and smooth user experiences
      <br />
      because good code isn’t just about working, it’s about feeling right!
      <br />
      <br />I care about accessibility and writing clean, team-friendly code
      that won’t make my coworkers rage-quit.
      <br /> Always willing to learn and grow!
